# Basic Guide
## Getting started
Dont know anything about Lua? Check out [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/index.htm) guide or any other you like

### Directory structure

Once you setup this plugin and generate all required folders it should look like this.
└── LuaLab --Generated by SL for your plugin.
    ├── LuaPlugins -- Put your .lua files here, anything in here will be executed on start
    │   └── deps -- Put any dependencies for your .lua files in here, they wont load unless you require them
    └── Config.yaml -- Plugin configuration file

## Main method
Lua doesnt have any entry point method, it is simply executed from top bottom. However, since I support hot reload, there is a dedicated method that runs only once for a whole Lua plugin. This means any global variables required and initially setup should be declared there with global scope.

For these reason, I automatically add a global variable named "plugin" which is a representation of plugin for .lua it is currently executing
`Plugin` object has several properties and events you can hook into:
`Name` - name of this plugin (Lua file it is executing basically)
`PluginPath` - Absolute path to this Lua file
`PluginLoaded` - This is the event I talked about few sentences above. It is executed only one time, which is when for the first time since server start this lua file is loaded. It is not executed with hot reload and etc
`PluginReloading` - Event that is fired before any reload code is executed internaly, save your unsaved stuff etc
`PluginReloaded` - Event that is fired after plugin is reloaded
`PluginUnloading` - Last method that is executed. Plugins may be unloaded forcefully by a command or with server stop/restart
